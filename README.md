<p> <h3>This project was for the purpose of training and illustrating my abilities in <b>Web Development</b>.</h3> <br/>
  In this Web App, a simple <b>Auction House</b> is imitated.<br/>
  Users can participate in ongoing auctions, or even commence their own auction.<br/>
  Optional yet UX friendly sections were implemented including <b>Watchlist</b>, <b>Commenting System</b> and...<br/>
  Authorization was considered regarding <b>Editing</b> and <b>Deleting</b> the listings themselves.<br/>
  Users can win the auction whenever the auction was closed either after the given time or at the auctioner's will.<br/> 
  Simple rules for a standard auction was applied. Any amount higher than the current bid would put you in the lead!<br/>
  The backend is developed with the help of <b>Django</b>, a Web Framework for Python. In terms of Front-end, with the help of <b>JavaScript</b>, specifically <b>React</b>, a delightful and interactive client-side environment was achieved.. Thanks to Bootstrapp, which is a CSS library, it has decent looks too.  the Database was handled with the PostgreSQL.
